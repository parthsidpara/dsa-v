Welcome to **Visualize DSA**, a web application that helps you master Data Structures and Algorithms through interactive visualizations. Whether you're learning Linked Lists, Sorting Algorithms, or Graphs, our platform offers a hands-on experience to understand and analyze these concepts intuitively.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Learn by visualizing concepts like Linked Lists, Sorting Algorithms, Stacks, Queues, and Graphs.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes to ensure a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple navigation to access different visualizers quickly.

### Available Visualizers
- **Linked List Visualizer**: Explore and manipulate Linked Lists interactively.
- **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer**: Understand sorting algorithms step by step.
- **Graph Visualizer**: Learn how Graphs work through dynamic visualization.
- **Stack Visualizer**: See Stacks in action.
- **Queue Visualizer**: Visualize Queue operations interactively.

## How to Use

1. Visit the website: [Visualize DSA](https://parthsidpara.github.io/dsa-v/).
2. Browse through the visualizers available in the **Explore Our Visualizers** section.
3. Click on a visualizer card to interact with the selected topic.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structure and content.
- **CSS3 with TailwindCSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements and dynamic content.
